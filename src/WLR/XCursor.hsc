{-
 - This is a stable interface of wlroots. Future changes will be limited to:
 -
 - - New functions
 - - New struct members
 - - New enum members
 -
 - Note that wlroots does not make an ABI compatibility promise - in the future,
 - the layout and size of structs used by wlroots may change, requiring code
 - depending on this header to be recompiled (but not edited).
 -
 - Breaking changes are announced in the release notes and follow a 1-year
 - deprecation schedule.

{-
 - A still cursor image.
 -
 - The buffer contains pixels layed out in a packed DRM_FORMAT_ARGB8888 format.

{-
 - Loads the named Xcursor theme.
 -
 - This is useful if you need cursor images for your compositor to use when a
 - client-side cursor is not available or you wish to override client-side
 - cursors for a particular UI interaction (such as using a grab cursor when
 - moving a window around).
 -
 - The size is given in pixels.
 -
 - If a cursor theme with the given name couldn't be loaded, a fallback theme
 - is loaded.
 -
 - On error, NULL is returned.
